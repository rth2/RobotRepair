Robot Repair

**Initial**
  Was starting as a free program that could be loaded onto a learning site. Main purpose was to serve as a portfolio piece to launch into more freelancing work.

**Ended**
  Before this was finished I was hired by a company. This gave me live game development experience and negated the need for Robot Repair as a portfolio / resume line.
  
  **Thoughts**
  While Robot Repair didn't get finished it was still a good experience getting practice creating systems to very particular specs (USA elementary school rubric) and
    working with client side custom API's, pipelines, and standards.
